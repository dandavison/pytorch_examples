class MnistLogistic(nn.Module):
    """
    Multinomial Logistic regression implemented as a neural network.

    In this ML training problem we have n observations x_i, where x_i \in \R^d.

    Each x_i is an image with 784 pixels, so d=784.

    We want to classify each x_i to one of K categories. In this case, K=10 -- the 10 possible
    digits.

    Multinomial Logistic Regression can be thought of as laying down a K-dimensional discrete
    probability distribution surface over each point in R^d. So any observation x has an associated
    output value y, given by the value of the surface above x.

    Variable names:

    x      a single input image vector \in R^{784}
    X      (n x 784) matrix containing n input vectors
    xw     the intermediate output of the linear part of the model:
           xw = x @ weights + bias
    yp     the output of the neural net for one input:
           a vector of multinomial logistic probabilities \in \R^{10}
    yhat   the label prediction derived from the probability vector yp
    y      the true label
